# Mendelian Randomization Analysis Scripts  
This repository provides reproducible scripts and tools for Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. It supports functions such as causal effect inference, heterogeneity testing, and sensitivity analysis.

## Project Description
Mendelian Randomization is a method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to evaluate the causal relationship between exposure factors (e.g., gene expression, metabolites) and disease outcomes. This repository includes:
- Core analysis scripts based on the R language.
- Data preprocessing tools.
- Visualization functions.
- Sensitivity analysis modules (e.g., MR-Egger, weighted median, Leave-one-out).

## Usage Instructions
### Input Data Requirements
1. Exposure data:
   - It should contain SNP names, effect alleles, other alleles, effect sizes, and standard errors.
2. Outcome data:
   - The format is the same as the exposure data.
3. Covariate data (optional): Information on confounding factors.
