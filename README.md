# Mendelian Randomization Analysis Scripts  
This repository provides reproducible scripts and tools for Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. It supports functions such as causal effect inference, heterogeneity testing, and sensitivity analysis.

## Project Description
Mendelian Randomization is a method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to evaluate the causal relationship between exposure factors (e.g., gene expression, metabolites) and disease outcomes. This repository includes:
- Core analysis scripts based on the R language.
- Data preprocessing tools.
- Visualization functions.
- Sensitivity analysis modules (e.g., MR-Egger, weighted median, Leave-one-out).
